## User Manual

### NSTEP Clients

#### Selecting a questionnaire  
From the root page, you can select a questionnaire from the dropdown menu to respond to.  
#### Answering a questionnaire
When answering a questionnaire, each question requires a response. For questions that have video/audio feedback enabled, you may choose to record a video or audio clip (but not both) as a response. You can see a preview of your clip after you stop recording, and redo the process if necessary. You may also include a typed response in addition to your recording. Submit after you have completed the questionnaire.

### Admins

#### Signing in
From the root page, you can go to the login page by clicking "Admin Login" near the bottom. Enter your login credentials to sign in. If you do not know your login credentials and your account was created for you, contact your supervisor.  
#### Creating a questionnaire
If your account has permission, you may create a questionnaire by clicking the "create form" button under the "forms" tab in the home page. You can give your form a title and add form elements to your form. Each form element consists of a question, a switch for toggling video/audio feedback options, and a button to delete the form element. Configure your questionnaire as desired and save. Your questionnaire will now appear in the dropdown menu in the root page so people can respond to it.  
#### Editing a questionnaire
All active questionnaires will appear under the "forms" tab in the home page. To edit a questionnaire, click on the title, make your changes, and save. To delete a questionnaire, click the red "X" beside the title and confirm your intention. Please note that deleting a questionnaire also deletes its corresponding feedback, and that the actions described above require the right permissions.  
#### Viewing feedback
From the home page, you can navigate to the "feedback" tab to see a list of all available feedback. Each entry displays the questionnaire title and the time submitted, and entries are ordered by time with the most recent appearing at the top. You can search for feedback by questionnaire title to see feedback for a specific questionnaire. Clicking on an entry allows you to view the details of that response, and delete it if you wish.  
#### Viewing account details
You can click on the account icon in the navigation bar to view your account settings, which include your permissions and email address.  

### Super Admins

From the account details page, you can click the "manage admins" button to see a list of emails associated with admin accounts.  
#### Adding an admin account
To create an admin account, click the "add an admin" button on the manage administrators page, and enter your desired credentials. Select the permissions you would like for this account to have and save.  
#### Editing an admin account
To edit an admin account, click the edit icon beside the email associated with the account on the manage administrators page, adjust the permissions as you see fit, and save. If you would like to remove the account, click the "delete" button at the bottom of the page and confirm your intention.
