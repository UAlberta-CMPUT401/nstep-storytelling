<p>This web application will allow NSTEP to hear the stories of their diverse group of clients by enabling them to share their experiences with NSTEP, and give NSTEP a qualitative measure of assessment by which to evaluate the quality of their programs and report to funding agencies. The application will support multiple languages and allow clients to give feedback in various formats (text, audio, video, etc), as well as allow admins to set up questionnaires and view stories.
